// src/components/sections/) is meant to eventually assemble. Hero/Why/
// Services/Process/FAQ content below is sourced verbatim (minus markdown
// emphasis markers, which these components render as plain text) from
// docs/page-content/final-mvp-development.md — real copy fetched from
// the live paistudio.co page, not generic filler. FAQ questions are the
// real ones from that page too; the source file left answers as
// "[PLACEHOLDER]" (the live page has no visible answers), so the answers
// here are newly written but grounded only in facts already established
// elsewhere on this page/site — no invented case studies or metrics.
// BusinessImpactSection and QualificationSection aren't covered by the
// source file, so they're left as they were.
