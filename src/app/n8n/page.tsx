// Tool Deep-Dive only to tool pages: Bubble, n8n, Softr, Airtable,
// Lovable, Claude AI — not offering pages; not built into any page yet).
// Hero/Why/Services/Process/FAQ content below is sourced verbatim (minus
// markdown emphasis markers, which these components render as plain
// text) from docs/page-content/final-n8n.md — real copy fetched from
// the live paistudio.co page, not generic filler. That file's own notes:
// the live page actually ships 4 "why" pillars/4 process steps
// (condensed to 3/3 here per this project's fixed-count section specs —
// see its condensing-choice notes), and separately flags a real
// copy-paste bug on the live page (its "why" intro wrongly said
// "Framer development services") which this rewrite does not carry
// over. FAQ questions are the real ones from that page too; the source
// file left answers as "[PLACEHOLDER]" (the live page has no visible
// answers), so the answers here are newly written but grounded only in
// facts already established elsewhere on this page/site.
// BusinessImpactSection and QualificationSection aren't covered by the
// source file, so they're left as they were.
