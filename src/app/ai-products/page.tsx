// One of the 12 offering/tool pages the section library (SEC-01–SEC-10,
// src/components/sections/) is meant to eventually assemble. Hero/Why/
// Services/Process/FAQ content below is sourced verbatim (minus markdown
// emphasis markers, which these components render as plain text) from
// docs/page-content/final-ai-products.md — real copy fetched from the
// live paistudio.co page, not generic filler. FAQ questions are the real
// ones from that page too; the source file left answers as
// "[PLACEHOLDER]" (the live page has no visible answers), so the answers
// here are newly written but grounded only in facts already established
// elsewhere on this page/site — no invented metrics or model claims.
// BusinessImpactSection and QualificationSection aren't covered by the
// source file, so they're left as they were.
