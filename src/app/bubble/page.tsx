// Hero/Why/Services/Process/FAQ content below is sourced verbatim (minus
// markdown emphasis markers, which these components render as plain
// text) from docs/page-content/final-bubble.md — real copy fetched from
// the live paistudio.co page, not generic filler. Per that file's own
// note, Bubble is Paistudio's core service (confirmed from the live
// site's own positioning as a Bubble agency). FAQ questions are the real
// ones from that page too; the source file left answers as
// "[PLACEHOLDER]" (the live page has no visible answers), so the answers
// here are newly written but grounded only in facts already established
// elsewhere on this page/site — no invented facts about Bubble's
// platform policies. BusinessImpactSection and QualificationSection
// aren't covered by the source file, so they're left as they were.

                question: "What is Bubble development?",
                answer:
                  "It's building a real, production-grade application on Bubble — data modeling, custom workflow logic, and API/plugin integration — rather than treating it as a simple form-and-database tool.",
              },
              {
                question: "Can Bubble apps be self-hosted?",
                answer:
                  "Bubble is a hosted platform by design — your app runs on Bubble's own infrastructure rather than servers you manage yourself. We can walk through hosting, custom domains, and data portability specifics for your situation before you commit.",
              },
              {
                question: "How does Bubble handle scale and performance?",
                answer:
                  "Performance comes down to how the app is architected — data structure, workflow logic, and query patterns — as much as the platform itself. We optimize both as usage grows rather than treating launch-day performance as the finish line.",
              },
              {
                question: "Can you migrate an existing Bubble app to us?",
                answer:
                  "Yes — we can take over an existing app, audit its data model and workflows, and continue building on it rather than requiring a rebuild from scratch.",
              },
              {
                question: "Do you provide ongoing support for Bubble apps?",
                answer:
                  "Yes — we optimize performance and extend features as your app and its usage grow, rather than stopping at initial launch.",
