// the real ones from that page too; the source file left answers as
// "[PLACEHOLDER]" (the live page has no visible answers), so the answers
// here are newly written but grounded only in facts already established
// elsewhere on this page/site — no invented facts about Airtable's
// platform limits. BusinessImpactSection and QualificationSection aren't
// covered by the source file, so they're left as they were.

                  "It's building a real operational backend on Airtable — relational base architecture, native automations and interfaces, and external integrations — rather than treating it as a plain spreadsheet.",

                question: "Can Airtable handle large datasets?",
                answer:
                  "Airtable is built for structured operational data rather than big-data scale, and its record limits vary by plan — we'll size a base against your actual data volume during scoping so it fits comfortably, and flag it early if a project would outgrow it.",
              },

                question: "Can Airtable integrate with automation tools like n8n?",

                  "Yes — Airtable connects cleanly to automation platforms and other tools via API, which is exactly how we handle external integration work on top of a base.",
              },
              {
                question: "Do you migrate existing spreadsheets into Airtable?",
                answer:
                  "Yes — we model your existing spreadsheet data into a proper relational structure (linked records instead of flat rows) as part of base architecture, not just an import.",

              {
