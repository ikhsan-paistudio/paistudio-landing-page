// Tool Deep-Dive only to tool pages: Bubble, n8n, Softr, Airtable,
// Lovable, Claude AI — not offering pages; not built into any page yet).
// Hero/Why/Services/Process/FAQ content below is sourced verbatim (minus
// markdown emphasis markers, which these components render as plain
// text) from docs/page-content/final-claude-ai.md — real copy fetched
// from the live paistudio.co page, not generic filler. FAQ questions are
// the real ones from that page too; the source file left answers as
// "[PLACEHOLDER]" (the live page has no visible answers), so the answers
// here are newly written but grounded only in facts already established
// elsewhere on this page/site — no invented claims about specific Claude
// model capabilities or lineup. BusinessImpactSection and
// QualificationSection aren't covered by the source file, so they're
// left as they were.
