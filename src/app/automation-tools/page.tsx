// One of the 12 offering/tool pages the section library (SEC-01–SEC-10,
// src/components/sections/) is meant to eventually assemble. Hero/Why/
// Services/Process/FAQ content below is sourced verbatim (minus markdown
// emphasis markers, which these components render as plain text) from
// docs/page-content/final-automation-tools.md — real copy fetched from
// the live paistudio.co page, not generic filler. Per that file's own
// note, this offering is deliberately platform-agnostic (n8n, Make,
// Zapier, custom) — distinct from the dedicated /n8n tool page — so it
// stays general rather than n8n-specific, avoiding duplicate content
// between the two pages. FAQ questions are the real ones from that page
// too; the source file left answers as "[PLACEHOLDER]" (the live page
// has no visible answers), so the answers here are newly written but
// grounded only in facts already established elsewhere on this
// page/site. BusinessImpactSection and QualificationSection aren't
// covered by the source file, so they're left as they were.
