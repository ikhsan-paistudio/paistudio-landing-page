// First of the 12 offering/tool pages the section library (SEC-01–SEC-10,
// src/components/sections/) is meant to eventually assemble. Currently
// wires up SEC-01 (Hero), SEC-02 (Value Pillars), SEC-03 (Services),
// SEC-04 (Services — scroll-driven accordion), SEC-06 (Business Impact),
// SEC-08 (Qualification), and SEC-10 (FAQ) — the rest (Proof, Pricing)
// isn't built into this page yet; adding those wasn't asked for here.
// Hero/Why/Services/Process/FAQ content below is sourced verbatim (minus
// markdown emphasis markers, which these components render as plain
// text) from docs/page-content/saas-web-app-development-final.md — real
// copy fetched live from paistudio.co (homepage + /n8n-development, used
// as tone reference), not generic filler, matching how the other 11
// offering/tool pages were sourced from their own final-*.md files. FAQ
// questions are the real ones from that source too; it left answers as
// "[PLACEHOLDER]" (the live n8n page it cross-checked against also ships
// FAQ questions with no visible answers — a real content gap, not
// laziness), so the answers here are newly written but grounded only in
// facts already established elsewhere on this page/site — no invented
// case studies, pricing, or metrics.
//
// Positioning tension flagged by the source file itself, worth surfacing
// rather than silently resolving: this page's real copy leans general
// full-stack/custom-code language ("frontend, backend, database,"
// "modern frameworks") without mentioning Bubble or no-code, while the
// rest of this site (and every other offering page here) positions
// Paistudio as Bubble/no-code-first. That's carried through faithfully
// as written in the source rather than "corrected" toward Bubble-specific
// language that isn't actually in the real copy — SEC-04 below still
// consolidates the same Bubble-flavored capabilities it did before this
// update for exactly that reason (SEC-03 above no longer mentions Bubble
// by name, so SEC-04 doesn't either). If custom-code and no-code are
// meant to be two distinct service lines, this page's copy should say so
// explicitly — right now a visitor could reasonably wonder which one
// "SaaS Development" refers to here.
//
// SEC-06's benefits are grounded the same way as before — this page has
// no SEC-05 (Proof) cases to trace them to, so they're tied instead to
// facts already established elsewhere on this page rather than to
// unsupported claims. SEC-08's good-fit/not-a-fit rows are similarly
// unchanged from the prior pass. SEC-04 no longer has an eyebrow or a
// link/button (both removed on request) — just a headline + subheader
// above the accordion.

Custom development gives you full ownership of your stack when performance, integrations, or scale genuinely require it; for many products, a fast, well-built no-code foundation is the better first move.
