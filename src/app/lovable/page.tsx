// here are newly written but grounded only in facts already established
// elsewhere on this page/site — no invented facts about Lovable's
// platform terms. BusinessImpactSection and QualificationSection aren't
// covered by the source file, so they're left as they were.

                  "It's using Lovable's AI-powered builder to scaffold a working application fast, then treating that scaffold as a starting point — reviewed, refactored, and hardened by us into something maintainable, not shipped as-is.",

                question: "Is the code Lovable generates production-ready as-is?",
                answer:
                  "Generally not without review — AI-generated scaffolding is a fast starting point, not a finished product. Human review and hardening is a standard part of how we work with it, not an optional add-on.",

                  "Lovable generates a standard, exportable codebase rather than locking you into a proprietary runtime — we can confirm the exact ownership and export terms for your plan before you commit.",
              },
              {
                question: "How much manual work happens after generation?",
                answer:
                  "It varies by project, but expect real engineering — reviewing and refactoring the generated code, filling gaps the scaffold doesn't cover, and hardening it for real users rather than treating generation as the finish line.",
