// Tool Deep-Dive only to tool pages: Bubble, n8n, Softr, Airtable,
// Lovable, Claude AI — not offering pages; not built into any page yet).
// Hero/Why/Services/Process/FAQ content below is sourced verbatim (minus
// markdown emphasis markers, which these components render as plain
// text) from docs/page-content/final-softr.md — real copy fetched from
// the live paistudio.co page, not generic filler. FAQ questions are the
// real ones from that page too; the source file left answers as
// "[PLACEHOLDER]" (the live page has no visible answers), so the answers
// here are newly written but grounded only in facts already established
// elsewhere on this page/site — no invented facts about Softr's platform
// capabilities. BusinessImpactSection and QualificationSection aren't
// covered by the source file, so they're left as they were.

                  "It's building a polished, permissioned front end on top of data you likely already have — a client portal, directory, or dashboard — rather than a raw spreadsheet view or a full custom app built from scratch.",

                question: "Does Softr require Airtable, or can it use other data sources?",
                answer:
                  "Softr natively integrates with both Airtable and Google Sheets, so it can build on whichever one your data already lives in without requiring a migration.",

                answer:
                  "Access control and gated content are handled natively — we define user permission levels during data and access planning, before the interface gets built.",
              },

                question: "Can Softr sites be white-labeled?",
