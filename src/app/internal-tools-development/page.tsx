// One of the 12 offering/tool pages the section library (SEC-01–SEC-10,
// src/components/sections/) is meant to eventually assemble. Hero/Why/
// Services/Process/FAQ content below is sourced verbatim (minus markdown
// emphasis markers, which these components render as plain text) from
// docs/page-content/final-internal-tools-development.md — real copy
// fetched from the live paistudio.co page, not generic filler. FAQ
// questions are the real ones from that page too; the source file left
// answers as "[PLACEHOLDER]" (the live page has no visible answers), so
// the answers here are newly written but grounded only in facts already
// established elsewhere on this page/site — no invented case studies or
// metrics. BusinessImpactSection and QualificationSection aren't covered
// by the source file, so they're left as they were.

                  "It's building dashboards, admin panels, or ops tools around how your team actually works — mapped to your real workflow and connected to your existing data, rather than a generic off-the-shelf tool you have to adapt to.",

                  "Yes — direct integration with your existing databases and services is core to how we build, so your team isn't re-entering data that already lives somewhere else.",

                answer:
                  "We choose whichever is right sized for the tool — no-code/low-code platforms for most internal tools, custom code where the requirements genuinely need it, rather than defaulting to one approach regardless of fit.",

              {
                question: "How do you handle role-based permissions?",

                  "Access levels are part of the design phase, not an afterthought — we define who sees and can edit what before the interface gets built.",
