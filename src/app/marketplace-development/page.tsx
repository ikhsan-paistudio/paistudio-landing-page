// questions are the real ones from that page too; the source file left

// the answers here are newly written but grounded only in facts already
// established elsewhere on this page/site — no invented case studies or
// metrics. BusinessImpactSection and QualificationSection aren't covered

                  "Payment processing, escrow, and split payouts are integrated as part of the transaction lifecycle from the start, using established payment infrastructure rather than a custom-built solution unless your case genuinely needs one.",
