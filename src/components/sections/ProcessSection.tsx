// step's image via that step's own `ServiceItem.image` instead — see
// marketplace-development's step 1) rather than requiring per-page image
// props for every step. Every page's `items` array is exactly 3 long (see
// the `items.length` dev-only check below), so the index mapping lines up
// 1:1 with no leftover step. Real source dimensions are 1030×642 (~16:10,
// matching this component's own preview aspect ratio almost exactly), so

/** SEC-04 · Services — pure-CSS sticky-stacking-cards accordion. No
 * scroll-linked JS at all for the core collapse effect — this replaced
 * an earlier GSAP `ScrollTrigger` scrub-driven version entirely, on
 * request ("use this for scroll animation" + the exact sticky-stacking
 * technique below).
 *
 * **How it actually works** — it's genuinely just `position: sticky` +
 * `z-index` layering, not a height/opacity animation of any kind:
 * - The right-column `<ul>` is `position: relative`.
 * - Every `<li>` is ALSO `position: sticky`, each with a progressively
 *   larger `top` (`NAV_CLEARANCE + i * HEADER_HEIGHT`) — item 0 pins
 *   right under the nav, item 1 pins one header-height lower, item 2 two
 *   header-heights lower, and so on.
 * - Every `<li>` has an opaque `bg-paper` background and an increasing
 *   `z-index` (`i + 1`, inline style since it's dynamic per index), so
 *   later items in the DOM paint over earlier ones once they scroll into
 *   their own pinned position. Deliberately no `overflow: hidden`
 *   anywhere in this chain.
 * - `.service-header` (number + title) is a fixed `h-16` row sitting
 *   flush at the very top of its `<li>` — always visible, identical
 *   markup regardless of scroll position, no "active" class needed at
 *   all. Its height must equal `HEADER_HEIGHT` exactly (both are 64px,
 *   kept in sync by the constant + the `h-16` class): the visible
 *   "sliver" of an already-passed item is exactly the vertical distance
 *   between its own `top` and the *next* item's `top`, which is only
 *   guaranteed to equal one full, uncropped header row if nothing (e.g.
 *   padding) sits above the header inside the `<li>`.
 * - `.service-body` (description, preview, tags) is ordinary content in
 *   normal flow directly below the header, inside the same sticky
 *   `<li>` — no height animation, no opacity toggle, no JS touches it at
 *   all. It's simply visible whenever its `<li>` is the topmost pinned
 *   box, and gets visually covered by the *next* `<li>`'s opaque box
 *   sliding up over it as that one reaches its own `top` and pins in
 *   turn.
 * - Total scroll-runway height is just the natural sum of every item's
 *   real rendered height — no manual `min-h` slots, no artificial
 *   spacing, no `IntersectionObserver`, no scroll library. The
 *   pin/release behavior falls out of plain `position: sticky` once the
 *   (naturally tall) list runs out, same as `ServicesSection`'s own
 *   sticky sidebar.
 *
 * **Reduced motion**: nothing to gate — unlike the previous GSAP version,
 * this is plain CSS positioning following the user's own scroll, not an
 * autoplaying/continuous-motion effect (the same reasoning this site's
 * fixed `Nav` bar isn't gated behind that preference either). The per-step
 * preview image is a static `next/image` per step (see
 * `PROCESS_STEP_IMAGES`) — it used to be a `prefers-reduced-motion`-aware
 * autoplaying crossfade across all 3 images, but that no longer applies
 * now that each step shows just its own one matching image.
 *
 * **Mobile (`≤900px`, matching SEC-03's breakpoint)**: both the left
 * column and every `<li>` drop `position: sticky` to `static`. Once
 * items aren't sticky they stop stacking/covering each other at all, and
 * each item's full header+body just flows normally in the document —
 * which *is* "list them all expanded" for free, with zero extra logic.
 * No separate mobile DOM branch needed at all (the previous GSAP version
 * needed one; this technique doesn't).
 *
 * **No pills/tags** — `ServiceItem` originally had a `tags: string[]`
 * field rendered as pill badges under the preview image; removed
 * entirely on request ("remove pill di dalam accordion"), not just
 * hidden — the prop is gone from the type too.
 *
 * **Headline/first-item top alignment**: the left column used to carry
 * its own `py-20`, independent of the section's own padding — which,
 * since the right column's `<ul>` has no padding of its own, put the
 * headline ~80px lower than "01 [title]" instead of level with it. Fixed
 * by moving vertical spacing to the *section* itself (`py-20`) and
 * dropping the left column's own padding entirely — matching how
 * `ServicesSection` (SEC-03) structures the exact same two-column
 * layout, on request ("biar konsisten kaya section lain"). Both columns
 * now start flush at the same top edge. */
