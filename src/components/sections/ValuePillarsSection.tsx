/** SEC-02 · Value Pillars — redesigned on direct request from the
 * original spec's static 4-card 2×2 grid into a 3-card horizontal strip,
 * all sitting in one light-gray rounded container, with a hover
 * interaction: the hovered card grows (others shrink to make room) and a
 * product-preview image reveals inside it.
 *
 * Each card's own content is an h-stack, not a v-stack with an
 * absolutely-positioned image overlay (an earlier pass here did that) —
 * text and the preview image are two ordinary flex children sharing the
 * card, so the image sits inside the card's own padding like the text
 * does, rather than bleeding past it via negative offsets. The 50/50
 * split only happens *while hovered*: at rest the image column's
 * `flex-grow`/opacity are both 0 (zero width, invisible) so text alone
 * fills the card; on hover both columns animate to equal `flex-grow`
 * (1:1 — genuinely 50/50) while the image fades in. Text itself uses
 * `justify-between` (not a plain stacked v-stack) so the number+heading
 * group sits at the top and the description is pinned to the bottom of
 * the card's height, rather than just flowing top-down with a gap.
 *
 * Placeholder images only for now — `#E0E0E0`, the lightest grey already
 * established in this project for image placeholders (see
 * `ContainedImage`/`SplitImageRow` in `work/detail-v2/`) — lighter than
 * the `#d9d7d0` placeholder tone this component (and `WorkGallery`'s
 * `GalleryTile`) used before. No real image props yet, still matching
 * this project's placeholder convention rather than wiring up
 * `next/image` against fabricated file paths.
 *
 * Width changes are `flex-grow` transitions (not `width`/`flex-basis`) —
 * animating `flex-grow` is well supported in evergreen browsers and is
 * the standard technique for both the card-level expand-on-hover and the
 * inner text/image 0→50/50 reveal, since a ratio between grow values does
 * the resizing automatically. Duration is 350ms ease-out throughout,
 * inside the spec's requested 300–400ms range.
